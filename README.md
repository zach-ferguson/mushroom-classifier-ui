# mushroom_classifier_ui

This is a flutter app made to interface with an image classifier model served by a FastAPI python backend [hosted on huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zferg1/mushroom-classifier-api).

The model was created with the [fastai library](https://www.fast.ai/) and trained with a fungus image dataset from [marcosvolpato](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcosvolpato/edible-and-poisonous-fungi), so big shout out to him for making this dataset available for open use.
